# WIP - Hotel Room Search & Booking Service
## A frontend mockup

This is a frontend learning project where I practice HTML & CSS, learn and implement JavaScript and some popular frontend technologies (see Stack).

**Project Pages:**
* [Project mockup (UI Kit)](https://lp5.github.io/toxin/dist/index.html)

**Stack:**
* Webpack - module bundler
* Pug - HTML template engine
* Sass - CSS extension (I use SCSS syntax)
* JavaScript - a scripting language
